# Job-Searcher

Hey Guys, this is my first try for web-scrapping using python.
With it you can find the best job searched for you automatically.
Only thing you will have to do is to run this file then tell it what you want to do (eg Programming, Sculpting etc.) and one thing that you dont wanna do.
And the rest is it's responsibility, it will save the latest jobs posted in under last three days related to your choice in the posts folder alongwith the date and time of when you searched for it so that you wont have confussion later thet when did you searched for it.

Thing that would be saved:
i) Date and time of searching.
ii) Name of the Company that posted the job.
iii) Required Skills.
iv) And a link to read more about that job.

And of course you can add more things to it if yu work a little on this. The possiblities tare Endless.
